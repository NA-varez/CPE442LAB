Hello! This is the README.txt for Lab 2! 

IMAGE DISPLAYING

Within the lab2/ directory type the command:


make


Once the 'DisplayImage' executable has been created follow up with:


./DisplayImage toad.jpg		(noting scary just a large toad)


Simple displaying of a picture using an executable compiled using a 
MakeFile and including opencv4 library.
