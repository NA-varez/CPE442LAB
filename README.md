## Makefile and Compiling with GCC

### What is the point of a Makefile?
A Makefile is a way of ***automating*** the process of compiling code. There are 3 advantages to a Makefile that are at the core of its use:

1. Automatically determine what files have been edited and need to be rebuilt (recompiled).
2. If working in a team. Everyone can stay consistent with the same build process.
3. Saves time by rebuilding only what is necessary.
